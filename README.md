This is the distro verion of the HFI1 and associated drivers with additional
fixes and improvements by Cornelis Networks for things that have not filtered
down into the distros yet. This is a bridge between distro and upstream
kernel.org drivers.

All changes to build and other ancillary files should probably be checked into
the master branch. This branch will then get checked out to start each distro.
