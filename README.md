This is the distro version of the hfi1 and associated drivers with additions
for:

1) GPU Support for both Nvidia and AMD
2) Fixes from upstream that have not filtered into the distros yet
3) Diagnostic/debugging support not appropriate for upstream submission
4) Hot fixes

These drivers are incorporated into official Cornelis Networks OPXS builds from
time to time. Tags will indicate which OPXS release that a particular branch
corresponds to. 

Checking out changes that are not tagged should be considered in
development and a work in progress. These have not yet been through a full
validation cycle. While we expect the code to work it is still in testing and
your mileage may vary. Please report any bugs through the issue tracker or
Cornelis Networks support.
